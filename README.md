Utilities for building and managing
[bioconda](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes) recipes.

Installation:

First, note that `bioconda-utils` requires both python3 and `conda-build` pre-installed.  
This means that you likely need to have installed conda via the `miniconda3` bundle.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-utils.git
```

See the help for the `bioconda-utils` command-line interface for details:

```
bioconda-utils -h
```
